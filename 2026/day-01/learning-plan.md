- What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

    My understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering is that it automates the flow of code in production and helps infra to handle things like - debugging , scalablity ,security and all the operational related essentials, with the help of  some tools like - docker , kubernetes , argo cd , and collabrating tools like - github , gitlab and etc . 


- Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

    Currently I , am at a higher position in my organisation. To handle things better in production , i am learning devops and cloud.


- Where do you want to reach?

    I want to reach at position where i can manage everything at  production related to devops and cloud although i am learing few other things as well like system design and brushing up programming concept(of python).


- How you will stay consistent every single day?

    I know consistency is the key , my mantra is simple and clear to upskill my self is . 
    DISCIPLINE CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION SINCERITY FOCUS CONCENTRAION DEDICATION and very beautiful of line "DISCIPLINE IS FLOWING" --> this means with the discipline i am connected to supreme power and flowing with ease, these are not just word for me , these are my vocabularies to reach at highest level .


- Mention your **current level**  

    working professional - Currently working as a gen ai engineer and managing some basic aiops worloads. I Know linux , git and github , docker. I am beginner in devops and cloud and but after 90 days i will reach so high , where i have not visualised my self. 

- Define **3 clear goals** for the next 90 days  
  
    1) How to automate the large code base.
    2) How to debug error in operation of these large code base.
    3) How to handle overall architecture or workflow of devops like managing kubernets , handling CI/CD pipeplines ,managing all the important tools, with cloud environments.

  
- Define **3 core DevOps skills** you want to build  
  
    I want to master and I already mastered the skills to achieve the above goals.
